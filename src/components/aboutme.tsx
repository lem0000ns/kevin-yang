        Outside of programming, I enjoy playing basketball, running, and
        learning languagesâ€”specifically Korean and Spanish. This is mainly done
        through listening to native content, such as podcasts or movies, or
        reading books. I've read the "Harry Potter" series three times, once
        completely in Spanish!
